## Introduction

In this article, we will explain how to use the monorepo tool Nx to serve a statically generated site created with Next.js SSG (Static Site Generation) from a Next.js application. This approach allows you to have both the frontend and backend in a single project.

## 1. Create Frontend and Backend Projects

### Create Nx Workspace and Nestjs Project

Navigate to the desired directory and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest

âœ” Where would you like to create your workspace? Â· sample-workspace
âœ” Which stack do you want to use? Â· node
âœ” What framework should be used? Â· nest
âœ” Integrated monorepo, or standalone project? Â· integrated
âœ” Application name Â· api
âœ” Would you like to generate a Dockerfile? [https://docs.docker.com/] Â· No
âœ” Enable distributed caching to make your CI faster Â· No
```

This will create the Nestjs `api` project.

### Create a Nextjs Project

```bash
nx g @nx/next:app web

âœ” Which stylesheet format would you like to use? Â· css
âœ” Which E2E test runner would you like to use? Â· cypress
âœ” Would you like to use the App Router (recommended)? (Y/n) Â· true
```

The directory structure created by the above commands will look like this:

```text
sample-workspace/
  |- apps/
  |    |- api/
  |    |- web/
```

## 2. Enable Nextjs (Frontend) for SSG (Static Site Generation)

To enable support for static files, make the following changes:

* Add `unoptimized: true` in `images` (SSG doesn't support `next/image`).
* Add `output: 'export'`.
* Add `trailingSlash: true`.

```js:apps/web/next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  nx: {
    // Set this to true if you would like to use SVGR
    // See: https://github.com/gregberge/svgr
    svgr: false
  }, 
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  }, 
  output: 'export', 
  trailingSlash: true
}; 
```

> If you don't set `trailingSlash: true`, when accessing Nextjs via Nestjs, reloading the browser on pages other than the homepage will redirect you to the homepage.
>
> [NEXT.JS trailingSlash](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/trailingSlash)

## 3. Add ServeStaticModule to Nestjs (Backend)

### Import the `serve-static` Package

```bash
npm i @nestjs/serve-static
```

### Implement the ServeStaticModule

```ts:apps/api/src/app/app.module.ts
import { ServeStaticModule } from '@nestjs/serve-static'; 
import path, { join } from 'path'; 
// Other standard imports are omitted

@Module({
  imports: [
    ServeStaticModule.forRoot({
      rootPath: join(__dirname, '..', 'web/.next'),
      exclude: ['/api/*']
    }),
  ], 
  controllers: [AppController], 
  providers: [AppService]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

With the above code, if the endpoint does not start with `/api`, it will redirect to the `.next` directory, which is the static site of Nextjs.

> At this point, the `.next` folder has not been generated yet. It will be generated later when you run Nextjs Build, as explained below.

## 4. Add Build and Start Commands to `package.json`

Add the build and start commands to your `package.json` file.

```json:package.json
"scripts": {
    "cd:build-api": "npx nx build api --prod",
    "cd:build-web": "npx nx build web --prod",
    "cd:build": "npm run cd:build-api && npm run cd:build-web",
    "cd:web-start:server": "cd dist/apps/web && npm run start",
    "cd:web-start:static": "npx serve dist/apps/web/.next",
    "cd:api-start": "node dist/apps/api/main.js"
}
```

Next, execute the build command:

```bash
npm run cd:build
```

This will generate build files for both the frontend (web) and backend (api).

Finally, execute the start command:

```bash
npm run cd:api-start
```

This will start the backend server on localhost, and you can access the Next.js pages in your browser.

By deploying these, you can serve both the frontend and backend integrated on a single server.

For reference, here is the directory structure after the build:

```text
sample-workspace/
  |- apps/
  |    |- api/
  |    |- web/
  |
  |-dist/  <= generated after the build
  |   |- apps/
  |        |- api/   
  |        |- web/
  |             |- .next/
  |
  |- package.json
```
