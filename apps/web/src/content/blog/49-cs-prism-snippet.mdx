## Registering Custom Code Snippets in Visual Studio Code

You can create code snippet files using the following steps:

1. Select **File > Preferences > User Snippets** from the code editor's top menu.

2. Snippets are written in JSON format.

## Code Snippets

### propp

Defines a property that requires update notifications.

```json
  "Create Bindable Property": {
    "scope": "csharp",
    "prefix": "propp",
    "body": [
      "private ${1:Type} _${3:${2/(.*)/${1:/camelcase}/}};",
      "public ${1:Type} ${2:Name}",
      "{",
      "   get { return _$3; }",
      "   set { SetProperty(ref _$3, value); }",
      ,
      "}"
    ],
    "description": "Create a property, with a backing field, that depends on BindableBase."
  }
```

#### About `${3:...}`

* `${2/(.*)/${1:/camelcase}/}`: This part is a combination of regular expression and replacement pattern. It generates the name of the backing field based on the value of `${2:Name}`.
* `(.*)`: This is a regular expression capture group. It captures the property name (Name) entered by the user.
* `${1:/camelcase}`: This is a replacement pattern for converting the captured string to camel case. `${1:...}` references the captured value, and `:camelcase` instructs camel case conversion.

### cmd

Delegate command.

```json
  "Create DelegateCommand Property": {
    "scope": "csharp",
    "prefix": "cmd",
    "body": [
      "public DelegateCommand ${1:Command} => new DelegateCommand(() =>", 
      "{", 
      "", 
      "});"
    ],
    "description": "Create a DelegateCommand property with a private setter."
  }
```

### cmdg

Parameterized delegate command.

```json
  "Create Generic DelegateCommand Property": {
    "scope": "csharp",
    "prefix": "cmdg",
