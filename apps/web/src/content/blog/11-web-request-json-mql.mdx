This is an article about MQL, a language used for FX trading in MetaTrader 4 (MT4).

In this article, we will introduce how to send JSON data using the WebRequest function to make requests to a web server.

## WebRequest Function
The WebRequest function is used to send HTTP requests to a specified web server. There are two variations of the WebRequest function with different sets of parameters. In this method, we will use the following type:

```cpp
int  WebRequest(
   const string      method,           // HTTP method
   const string      url,              // URL
   const string      headers,          // Headers
   int               timeout,          // Timeout
   const char        &data[],          // Array containing the HTTP message body
   char              &result[],        // Array containing the server's response data
   string            &result_headers   // Server response headers
   );
```

## Sending JSON Data via POST
Let's explain the steps to send JSON data via POST using the WebRequest function.

### â‘  Configure WebRequest-Allow URL
In MT4, you need to specify the URLs that are allowed for sending web requests.

First, launch MT4 and go to the menu bar, then select "Tools" -> "Options" -> "Expert Advisors."

In this window, you will find "Allow WebRequest URLs." Check the box and add the URL to which you want to send requests.

### â‘¡ POST JSON Data to the Web Server
We will illustrate sending text to a posting-enabled web server.

Suppose you have the following text:

Hello.
Goodbye.

To store this text in an MQL String variable, it will look like this:

```cpp
// Text prepared in MQL
string text;
text = "Hello." + "\n" + "Goodbye."
```

To send this text in JSON format, you need to convert it as follows:

```json
{"content":"Hello.\nGoodbye."}
```

Please note that the "content" part is just an example. It can vary depending on the target web server.

You need to convert the text into JSON format like the example above and then load it into the WebRequest function to send the request.

Here's an example in MQL:

```cpp
// Text prepared in MQL
string text;
text = "Hello." + "\n" + "Goodbye."
string headers;

// Convert text to JSON format and send the web request
string data;
char post[], result[];

// Create the header part
headers = "Content-Type: application/json\r\n";

// Create the body part
StringReplace(text, "\n", "\\n");
data = "{\"content\":\"" + text + "\"}";
ArrayResize(post, StringToCharArray(data, post, 0, WHOLE_ARRAY, CP_UTF8) - 1);

// Send the request
int rest = WebRequest("POST", *Web server URL*, headers, 5000, post, result, headers);
```

In the example above, special characters such as line breaks need to be converted into strings that can be recognized by JSON, so be cautious.

That's it!
